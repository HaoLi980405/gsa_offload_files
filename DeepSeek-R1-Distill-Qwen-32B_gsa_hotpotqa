Looking at the passages, the fourth studio album isn't directly mentioned, but considering his discography, it's likely \"Elvis Is Back!\" or another album. However, the song in question is from the Christmas album, which is the third. Therefore, the answer is that the song was released on the third studio album, not the fourth. But since the question specifies the fourth, and the passages don't mention a fourth studio album from 1957, the answer might be that it wasn't released on a fourth studio album in 1957.
